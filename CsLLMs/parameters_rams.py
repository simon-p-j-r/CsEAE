He has used these finding to give cover to thinly sourced theories about Clinton ’s health — in late August , he dug up an e - mail that showed that Clinton once received information about a Parkinson ’s disease drug — and inventing new anti - Clinton theories out of whole cloth . After Clinton claimed that Russian hackers had been the source of the leak , Assange deflected the allegation in part by pointing out that a low - level Democratic Party staffer , Seth Rich , had been murdered weeks earlier while <t> walking <t> home from a bar in Washington . Although police believe Rich was the victim of a botched robbery attempt , Assange hinted at a darker possibility : that Rich was murdered for sharing documents with WikiLeaks . “ Our sources take risks , ” Assange said ominously .
